<div>
    Sets the HTTP header <code>X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block</code> on all requests to enable automatic XSS blocking
    by web browsers that implement this feature. Web browsers typically interpret the lack of this header as using the
    value <code>1</code> which will sanitize suspected cross-site scripting attacks as opposed to fully blocking them.
