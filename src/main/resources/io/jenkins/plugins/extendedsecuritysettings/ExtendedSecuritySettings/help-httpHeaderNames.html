<div>
    Configure a set of restricted HTTP header names to remove from unauthorized users' responses.
    Header names are <em>case-insensitive.</em>
    Users lacking the <i>Overall/Read</i> permission will have these headers removed from HTTP responses.
    Example headers that can be filtered include:
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>X-Jenkins</kbd></li>
        <li><kbd>X-Hudson</kbd></li>
    </ul>
    Do note that some headers are set by Jetty directly such as <code>Server</code> which cannot be removed through this mechanism.
    This can only be modified using a reverse HTTP proxy.
    See for example <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_headers.html">mod_headers</a> in Apache Web Server.
